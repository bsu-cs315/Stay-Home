### Reflection  

The mid semester jam was a lot of fun to do and I learned a lot from my experience. I did what was suggested and tried to complete this in a single day, and it was quite a challenge. I had fun and did not have many technical issues along the way! I was able to speed through the initial project setup and spend most of my time coming up with objectives and a plot (somewhat). I think the most challenging part of this assignment was finding assets that would work with the theme of this jam. I think what I ended up with is great and fits well. Next time, I might do the planning ahead of time since I was aware of the theme and had time to do so. This would have sped up the development time and made things easier in the end. Overall, I think this game is complete and a success.
